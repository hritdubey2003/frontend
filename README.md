# Domain Data Insights

**Domain Data Insights** is a React-based web application that provides detailed insights into domain data. The app allows users to log in, view, search, and sort domain data fetched from a CSV file. This app is built with a clean and modern design, ensuring ease of use and an optimized user experience. It also includes protected routes, with user authentication via a simple login page.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login mechanism with a hardcoded username and password (`admin/admin`).
- **CSV Data Import**: Data is fetched from a CSV file and displayed in a responsive data table.
- **Search Functionality**: Search through domain data across multiple fields (e.g., domain name, traffic, etc.).
- **Sorting**: Sort domain data based on various fields such as domain name or traffic.
- **Pagination**: The table supports pagination for easy navigation through large datasets.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Protected Routes**: Only logged-in users can access the domain list page.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend (Optional)**: Can be extended with Express.js for API or Redis for in-memory data storage.
- **State Management**: React hooks for managing application state.
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation between login and domain list views.
- **CSV Parsing**: PapaParse for parsing CSV data.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive UI.
- **Icons**: React Icons for buttons and icons.

## Installation

## Usage

1. **Login**: 
   - Open the app and enter the login credentials (`username: demo`, `password: demo`).
   
2. **Domain Data Table**:
   - Once logged in, you will be directed to the domain data table page.
   - The table displays domain data fetched from a CSV file. 
   - You can **search** through the data, **sort** by columns (e.g., domain name, traffic), and use **pagination** to navigate large datasets.

3. **Logout**: 
   - To log out, simply close the app or implement additional logout functionality.

## File Details

### **App.jsx**
Contains the main routing logic. It imports the `Login` and `DomainList` components and renders them based on the route.

### **Login.jsx**
This is the login page where users can input their credentials. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the domain list page.

### **DomainList.jsx**
Displays the domain data in a table format. It allows users to search, sort, and paginate through the domain data.

### **Domain.csv**
Contains the domain data in CSV format that is parsed and displayed in the app.
